### TREE Data Structure

- Tree is a Data Structure has the balanced and unbalanced trees
- When we Called the Balanced and Unbalanced tree? think once ðŸ¤”
- if the difference between left height of the tree and right side of the tree is less than or equal to 1 then it is called as balanced tree else unbalanced
- if tree is balanced the height of the tree is logN base 2 
#### Why do we need binary tree
- To lookup faster
- Huffman trees compression of data
- Routing trees for the `Network Traffic`

** Different types of the Traversal IMPORTANT **
- DFS(Depth First Search)
    - PreOrder
    - InOrder
    - PostOrder
- BFS
    - Level order traversal
